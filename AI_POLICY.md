# AI Generated Contributions Policy

Artificial intelligence systems raise many questions around copyright that have
yet to be answered. As per the [GitHub TOS](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service#6-contributions-under-repository-license), contributors are responsible for ensuring that they have the
right to contribute code under the terms of the repository license. Using AI tools to
regenerate copyrighted material does not remove the copyright, and contributors
are responsible for ensuring that such material does not appear in their
contributions. Violations will be dealt with according to our [IP violation policy](./INTELLECTUAL_PROPERTY_VIOLATION_POLICY.md).

In short, MapLibre's policy on AI generated contributions is that contributors are permitted to
use artificial intelligence tools to produce contributions, provided that they have the right
to license that code under the relevant license.

While MapLibre has a liberal policy on AI tool use, contributors are
considered responsible for their contributions. We encourage contributors to
review all generated code before sending it for review to verify its
correctness and to understand it so that they can answer questions during code
review. Reviewing and maintaining generated code that the original contributor
does not understand is not a good use of limited project resources.
